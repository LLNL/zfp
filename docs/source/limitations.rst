Limitations
===========

|zfp| has evolved from a research prototype to a library that is approaching
production readiness.  However, the API and even the compression codec are
still undergoing changes as new important features are added.

Below is a list of known limitations of the current version of |zfp|.
See the section on :ref:`directions` for a discussion of planned features
that will address some of these limitations.

- Special floating-point values like infinity and NaN are supported in
  reversible mode but not in |zfp|'s lossy compression modes.  Subnormal
  floating-point numbers are, however, correctly handled.  There is an
  implicit assumption that floating point conforms to IEEE-754, though
  extensions to other floating-point formats should be possible with
  minor effort.

- The optional |zfp| :ref:`header <zfp-header>` supports arrays with at
  most 2\ :sup:`48` elements.  The |zfp| header limits each dimension
  to 2\ :sup:`48/d` elements in a *d*-dimensional array, i.e.,
  2\ :sup:`48`, 2\ :sup:`24`, 2\ :sup:`16`, and 2\ :sup:`12` for 1D through
  4D arrays, respectively.  Note that this limitation applies only to
  the header; array dimensions are otherwise limited only by the size
  of an unsigned integer.

- Conventional pointers and references to individual array elements are
  not available.  That is, constructions like :code:`double* ptr = &a[i];`
  are not possible when :code:`a` is a |zfp| array.  However, as of
  |zfp| 0.5.2, :ref:`proxy pointers <pointers>` are available that act much
  like pointers to uncompressed data.  Similarly, operators :code:`[]`
  and :code:`()` do not return regular C++ references.  Instead, a
  :ref:`proxy reference <references>` class is used (similar to how STL bit
  vectors are implemented).  These proxy references and pointers can,
  however, safely be passed to functions and used where regular references
  and pointers can.

- Although the current version of |zfp| supports :ref:`iterators <iterators>`,
  :ref:`pointers <pointers>`, and :ref:`references <references>` to array
  elements, 'const' versions of these accessors are not yet available for
  read-only access.

- |zfp| can potentially provide higher precision than conventional float
  and double arrays, but the interface currently does not expose this.
  For example, such added precision could be useful in finite difference
  computations, where catastrophic cancellation can be an issue when
  insufficient precision is available.

- Only single and double precision types are supported.  Generalizations
  to IEEE half and quad precision would be useful.  For instance,
  compressed 64-bit-per-value storage of 128-bit quad-precision numbers
  could greatly improve the accuracy of double-precision floating-point
  computations using the same amount of storage.

- Complex-valued arrays are not directly supported.  Real and imaginary
  components must be stored as separate arrays, which may result in lost
  opportunities for compression, e.g., if the complex magnitude is constant
  and only the phase varies.

- Version |cudarelease| adds support for CUDA compression and decompression.
  However, all compression modes are not yet supported (see the
  :ref:`execution` section).

- As of version |4drelease|, |zfp| supports compression and decompression
  of 4D arrays.  However, |zfp| does not yet implement a 4D compressed
  array C++ class.  This will be added in the near future.

- The :ref:`C wrappers <cfp>` for |zfp|'s compressed arrays support only
  basic array accesses.  There is currently no C interface for proxy
  references, pointers, iterators, or views.

- The Python and Fortran bindings do not yet support compressed arrays.
  Moreover, only a select subset of the :ref:`high-level API <hl-api>`
  is available via Python.

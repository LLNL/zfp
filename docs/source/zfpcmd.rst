File Compressor
===============

This section describes a simple, file-based |zfp| compression tool that is
part of the |zfp| distribution named |zfpcmd|.  Other, third-party,
file-based compression options are discussed in the
:ref:`Overview <overview>` section.

The |zfpcmd| executable in the :file:`bin` directory is primarily
intended for evaluating the rate-distortion (compression ratio and quality)
provided by the compressor, but since version 0.5.0 also allows reading and
writing compressed data sets.  |zfpcmd| takes as input a raw, binary
array of floats, doubles, or integers in native byte order and optionally
outputs a compressed or reconstructed array obtained after lossy compression
followed by decompression.  Various statistics on compression ratio and
error are also displayed.

The uncompressed input and output files should be a flattened, contiguous
sequence of scalars without any header information, generated for instance
by
::

    double* data = new double[nx * ny * nz];
    // populate data
    FILE* file = fopen("data.bin", "wb");
    fwrite(data, sizeof(*data), nx * ny * nz, file);
    fclose(file);


|zfpcmd| requires a set of command-line options, the most important
being the :option:`-i` option that specifies that the input is uncompressed.
When present, :option:`-i` tells |zfpcmd| to read an uncompressed input
file and compress it to memory.  If desired, the compressed stream can be
written to an output file using :option:`-z`.  When :option:`-i` is absent,
on the other hand, :option:`-z` names the compressed input (not output) file,
which is then decompressed.  In either case, :option:`-o` can be used to
output the reconstructed array resulting from lossy compression and
decompression.

So, to compress a file, use :code:`-i file.in -z file.zfp`.  To later
decompress the file, use :code:`-z file.zfp -o file.out`.  A single dash
"-" can be used in place of a file name to denote standard input or output.

When reading uncompressed input, the scalar type must be specified using
:option:`-f` (float) or :option:`-d` (double), or using :option:`-t`
for integer-valued data.  In addition, the array dimensions must be specified
using :option:`-1` (for 1D arrays), :option:`-2` (for 2D arrays),
:option:`-3` (for 3D arrays), or :option:`-4` (for 4D arrays).
For multidimensional arrays, *x* varies faster than *y*, which in turn
varies faster than *z*, and so on.  That is, a 4D input file corresponding
to a flattened C array :code:`a[nw][nz][ny][nx]` is specified as
:code:`-4 nx ny nz nw`.

.. note::
  Note that :code:`-2 nx ny` is not equivalent to :code:`-3 nx ny 1`, even
  though the same number of values are compressed.  One invokes the 2D codec,
  while the other uses the 3D codec, which in this example has to pad the
  input to an *nx* |times| *ny* |times| 4 array since arrays are partitioned
  into blocks of dimensions |4powd|.  Such padding usually negatively impacts
  compression.

In addition to ensuring correct dimensionality, the order of dimensions
also matters.  For instance, :code:`-2 nx ny` is not equivalent to
:code:`-2 ny nx`, i.e., with the dimensions transposed.

.. include:: disclaimer.inc

Using :option:`-h`, the array dimensions and type are stored in a header of
the compressed stream so that they do not have to be specified on the command
line during decompression.  The header also stores compression parameters,
which are described below.  The compressor and decompressor must agree on
whether headers are used, and it is up to the user to enforce this.

|zfpcmd| accepts several options for specifying how the data is to be
compressed.  The most general of these, the :option:`-c` option, takes four
constraint parameters that together can be used to achieve various effects.
These constraints are::

    minbits: the minimum number of bits used to represent a block
    maxbits: the maximum number of bits used to represent a block
    maxprec: the maximum number of bit planes encoded
    minexp:  the smallest bit plane number encoded

These parameters are discussed in detail in the section on
:ref:`compression modes <modes>`.  Options :option:`-r`, :option:`-p`,
and :option:`-a` provide a simpler interface to setting all of the above
parameters by invoking
:ref:`fixed-rate <mode-fixed-rate>` (:option:`-r`),
:ref:`-precision <mode-fixed-precision>` (:option:`-p`), and
:ref:`-accuracy <mode-fixed-accuracy>` (:option:`-a`) mode.
:ref:`Reversible mode <mode-reversible>` for lossless compression is
specified using :option:`-R`.

Usage
-----

Below is a description of each command-line option accepted by |zfpcmd|.

General options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. option:: -h

  Read/write array and compression parameters from/to compressed header.

.. option:: -q

  Quiet mode; suppress diagnostic output.

.. option:: -s

  Evaluate and print the following error statistics:

  * rmse: The root mean square error.
  * nrmse: The root mean square error normalized to the range.
  * maxe: The maximum absolute pointwise error.
  * psnr: The peak signal to noise ratio in decibels.

Input and output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. option:: -i <path>

  Name of uncompressed binary input file.  Use "-" for standard input.

.. option:: -o <path>

  Name of decompressed binary output file.  Use "-" for standard output.
  May be used with either :option:`-i`, :option:`-z`, or both.

.. option:: -z <path>

  Name of compressed input (without :option:`-i`) or output file (with
  :option:`-i`).  Use "-" for standard input or output.

When :option:`-i` is specified, data is read from the corresponding
uncompressed file, compressed, and written to the compressed file
specified by :option:`-z` (when present).  Without :option:`-i`,
compressed data is read from the file specified by :option:`-z`
and decompressed.  In either case, the reconstructed data can be
written to the file specified by :option:`-o`.

Array type and dimensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. option:: -f

  Single precision (float type).  Shorthand for :code:`-t f32`.

.. option:: -d

  Double precision (double type).  Shorthand for :code:`-t f64`.

.. option:: -t <type>

  Specify scalar type as one of i32, i64, f32, f64 for 32- or 64-bit
  integer or floating scalar type.

.. option:: -1 <nx>

  Dimensions of 1D C array :code:`a[nx]`.

.. option:: -2 <nx> <ny>

  Dimensions of 2D C array :code:`a[ny][nx]`.

.. option:: -3 <nx> <ny> <nz>

  Dimensions of 3D C array :code:`a[nz][ny][nx]`.

.. option:: -4 <nx> <ny> <nz> <nw>

  Dimensions of 4D C array :code:`a[nw][nz][ny][nx]`.

When :option:`-i` is used, the scalar type and array dimensions must be
specified.  One of :option:`-f`, :option:`-d`, or :option:`-t` specifies
the input scalar type.  :option:`-1`, :option:`-2`, :option:`-3`, or
:option:`-4` specifies the array dimensions.  The same parameters must
be given when decompressing data (without :option:`-i`), unless a header
was stored using :option:`-h` during compression.

Compression parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the following :ref:`compression modes <modes>` must be selected.

.. option:: -r <rate>

  Specify fixed rate in terms of number of compressed bits per
  integer or floating-point value.

.. option:: -p <precision>

  Specify fixed precision in terms of number of uncompressed bits per
  value.

.. option:: -a <tolerance>

  Specify fixed accuracy in terms of absolute error tolerance.

.. option:: -R

  Reversible (lossless) mode.

.. option:: -c <minbits> <maxbits> <maxprec> <minexp>

  Specify expert mode parameters.

When :option:`-i` is used, the compression parameters must be specified.
The same parameters must be given when decompressing data (without
:option:`-i`), unless a header was stored using :option:`-h` when
compressing.  See the section on :ref:`compression modes <modes>` for a
discussion of these parameters.

Execution parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. option:: -x <policy>

  Specify execution policy and parameters.  The default policy is
  :code:`-x serial` for sequential execution.  To enable OpenMP parallel
  compression, use the :code:`omp` policy.  Without parameters,
  :code:`-x omp` selects OpenMP with default settings, which typically
  implies maximum concurrency available.  Use :code:`-x omp=threads` to
  request a specific number of threads (see also
  :c:func:`zfp_stream_set_omp_threads`).  A thread count of zero is
  ignored and results in the default number of threads.  Use
  :code:`-x omp=threads,chunk_size` to specify the chunk size in number
  of blocks (see also :c:func:`zfp_stream_set_omp_chunk_size`).  A
  chunk size of zero is ignored and results in the default size.
  Use :code:`-x cuda` to for parallel CUDA compression and decompression.

As of |cudarelease|, the execution policy applies to both compression
and decompression.  If the execution policy is not supported for
decompression, then |zfp| will attempt to fall back on serial
decompression.  This is done only when both compression and decompression
are performed as part of a single execution, e.g., when specifying both
:option:`-i` and :option:`-o`.

Block Index
^^^^^^^^^^^

A block index is needed to support variable-rate decompression using any
of the parallel execution policies (OpenMP and CUDA).  This index must be
captured and stored to file during compression and later accessed prior to
decompression.

.. option:: -m <path>

  Name of block index input file (without :option:`-i`) or output file (with
  :option:`-i`).  Use "-" for standard input or output.

.. option:: -n <type=granularity>

  Block index type ("offset" or "hybrid") and granularity in number of blocks
  per index entry.  A granularity of one provides the highest flexibility and
  performance potential (especially for CUDA) but also the highest storage
  cost.

See the :ref:`hl-func-index` section for further details.
